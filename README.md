Problem: Must create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

Solution: This was a rush job as I only realized the homework was due this Monday evening. A lot of cutting and pasting, with only content editing. Probably should not count.
